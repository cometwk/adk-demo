(v0) Core Philosophy: "Bash is All You Need"
======================================

This is the ULTIMATE simplification of a coding agent. After building v1-v3,
we ask: what is the ESSENCE of an agent?

The answer: ONE tool (bash) + ONE loop = FULL agent capability.

Why Bash is Enough:
------------------
Unix philosophy says everything is a file, everything can be piped.
Bash is the gateway to this world:

    | You need      | Bash command                           |
    |---------------|----------------------------------------|
    | Read files    | cat, head, tail, grep                  |
    | Write files   | echo '...' > file, cat << 'EOF' > file |
    | Search        | find, grep, rg, ls                     |
    | Execute       | python, npm, make, any command         |
    | **Subagent**  | python v0_bash_agent.py "task"         |

The last line is the KEY INSIGHT: calling itself via bash implements subagents!
No Task tool, no Agent Registry - just recursion through process spawning.

How Subagents Work:
------------------
    Main Agent
      |-- bash: python v0_bash_agent.py "analyze architecture"
           |-- Subagent (isolated process, fresh history)
                |-- bash: find . -name "*.py"
                |-- bash: cat src/main.py
                |-- Returns summary via stdout

Process isolation = Context isolation:
- Child process has its own history=[]
- Parent captures stdout as tool result
- Recursive calls enable unlimited nesting

Usage:
    # Interactive mode
    python v0_bash_agent.py

    # Subagent mode (called by parent agent or directly)
    python v0_bash_agent.py "explore src/ and summarize"
